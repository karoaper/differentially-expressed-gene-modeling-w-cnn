This project implements the experimental pipeline for learning and analyzing the differentially expressed gene model.

The project uses primarily python code.  The model is based on convolutional neural nets, with EBLEARN being the 3rd party library containing the actual learning algorithm (http://eblearn.sourceforge.net/).  The code which calls the EBLEARN library and learns/tests the CNN model is written in C++.  The rest of the code for data pre-processing and model visualization is written in python.
